First we create a new table with the structure that was shown in the guide.
We learn how to import data from a .csv document.
First we needed to make the documents root accesible, so we procede to copy the file in /tmp/
Then we only have to paste this comand:
COPY us_counties_pop_est_2019
FROM 'C:\YourDirectory\us_counties_pop_est_2019.csv'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
The .csv imports around 3 thousand lines of data.
Also we learn how to limit the number of lines of data you want to be shown.

We create another table named supervisor_salaries and we repeat the procces of importing .csv data with other file.
We also learned how to make temp tables with data of other table so we can modify data and reinsert de data into the original table.
Another thing we learned is how to export data to a .txt file.
We can export the table with all columns or we can select what columns we want to export.
Also we can export queries.
COPY (
    SELECT county_name, state_name
    FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019
    WHERE county_name ILIKE '%mill%'
     )
TO '/tmp/us_counties_mill_export.csv'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
