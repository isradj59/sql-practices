Chapter_07
We learn how to join different tables.
SELECT *
FROM employees JOIN departments
ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id
ORDER BY employees.dept_id;
We practice different ways to join tables.
Make queries with 3 tables.
SELECT d20.id,
       d20.school_2020,
       en.enrollment,
       gr.grades
FROM district_2020 AS d20 JOIN district_2020_enrollment AS en
    ON d20.id = en.id
JOIN district_2020_grades AS gr
    ON d20.id = gr.id
ORDER BY d20.id;
Using Union it would not repeat data, using Union ALL it would show all results.
We also made more cmplex queries likes this.
SELECT c2019.county_name,
       c2019.state_name,
       c2019.pop_est_2019 AS pop_2019,
       c2010.estimates_base_2010 AS pop_2010,
       c2019.pop_est_2019 - c2010.estimates_base_2010 AS raw_change,
       round( (c2019.pop_est_2019::numeric - c2010.estimates_base_2010)
           / c2010.estimates_base_2010 * 100, 1 ) AS pct_change
FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019 AS c2019
    JOIN us_counties_pop_est_2010 AS c2010
ON c2019.state_fips = c2010.state_fips
    AND c2019.county_fips = c2010.county_fips
ORDER BY pct_change DESC;
That query is for joinning 2 different tables with 2 parameters and creating a column with math.
